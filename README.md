# salmon-cookies

Your friend Pat has come up with a business idea by combining his love for sweets and his passion for healthy ecosystems. Pat has developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. These cookies made into the shape of a salmon and are suitable for both humans and salmon to enjoy.

Pat’s Salmon Cookies needs a proof of concept application to calculate the number of cookies each location must make every day so that it can manage its supplies inventory and baking schedule. The number of cookies to make depends on the hours of operation (6:00 AM to 8:00 PM for all locations) and a few factors unique to each location:

The minimum number of customers per hour.
The maximum number of customers per hour.
The average number of cookies purchased per customer.

What is needed:

homepage to include:
Header with logo, nav, logo link
main
section
footer

We need to:

1. Brand the business
2.

1) Store the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties.
2) Use a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour. Objects/Math/random
3) Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated.
   4)Store the results for each location in a separate array… perhaps as a property of the object representing that location.
4) Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser.
   6 )Calculating the sum of these hourly totals; your output for each location should look like this:

Display the lists on sales.html.

Here are the starting numbers that you’ll need to build these objects:

Seattle:
min/cust - 23
max/cust - 65
Avg cookies/sales 6.3
Tokyo
min/cust - 3
max/cust - 24
Avg cookies/sales 1.2
Dubia
min/cust - 11
max/cust - 38
Avg cookies/sales 3.7
Paris
min/cust - 20
max/cust - 38
Avg cookies/sales 2.3
Lima
min/cust - 2
max/cust - 16
Avg cookies/sales 4.6

Make sure to make each location is its own JavaScript object.

1. A custom sans-serif Google Font for use in heading tags (<h# />)
2. A specified standard sans-serif web font for sales data (such as Arial, Verdana, or Helvetica).
3. A specified standard serif web font for text (such as Georgia, Times).
4. Specified different font colors for all three font uses.
5. A background color for the default page background (make sure font colors have good contrast and are readable on this background).
6. A different background color for elements such boxes and tables (so make sure the font colors contrast against this well, too!).
7. Anything else you’d like to add related to style. But remember: simplicity, clarity, and consistency are good things in design.
8. Be thoughtful about layout and overall organization of the page.
   Include all of the typical stuff that you’ll find on the home page of a business: locations, hours, contact information, some text about how awesome the business is, etc. Be creative, and again, think about what is meaningful to a typical end user.
